        <p>Shaddy Safadi is a video game concept artist who is the co-founder of One Pixel Brush, a concept firm
            headquartered in Santa Monica.</p>
        <p>Safadi was born with a passionate drive to become an artist for entertainment at a young age, though he was
            also interested in basketball. Applying to art colleges, he was turned down only by one school which was
            Art Center College of Design. Safadi was driven to be accepted into Art Center and took a year off work to
            improve his portfolio. After some time Safadi was finally accepted into Art Center for
            Illustration/Entertainment.</p>
