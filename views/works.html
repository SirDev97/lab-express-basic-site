        <p>In 2003, Safadi began working at Idol Minds Studio in Colorado on Neopets, and stayed with the studio for 2
            years, creating the look and style of the PS2 title Neopets: The Darkest Faerie. He later got an offer from
            a friend at the Game Developers Conference whom extended an offer at Naughty Dog. Working on an art test for
            what would be the Uncharted series, Shaddy was turned down but was given a second offer to work on the new
            Jak and Daxter title. The title would eventually be canceled and was offered to now work on the Uncharted
            title, producing sketches, style guides and detailed digital paintings which helped establish lighting, and
            color. Starting as a concept artist, Safadi had a difficult time adjusting to the realistic style of
            Uncharted, and was nearly taken off the Naughty Dog team. Safadi would learn to embrace the new style after
            playing Uncharted: Drakeâ€™s Fortune for the first time and understood the overall vision of the game.[2] He
            then began working on Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and was able to work on character concepts for Drake,
            Chloe, Tenzin, Elena and the Guardians. As well as creating set piece paintings for the game which involved
            working closely with the art director, and the game director</p>
